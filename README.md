This is the code to my old Dank Memer clone bot. Decided to open-source this thing since it's not going to be updated anytime soon.

This bot was also just a joke bot between me and my friends who used to always grind on Dank Memer, and was the 2nd ever bot I've ever coded in discord.js, so if you plan on copying this for your own use, do so with caution.

It may be better than trying to figure it all out on your own, but the code is slightly atrocious. It also takes many things from [the discord.js guide](https://discordjs.guide), so you might be better off looking there to start a discord.js bot instead of copying this.

I also made a .NET rewrite somewhere in February of this year, which was also cancelled. And as you guessed, it's also hot garbage, but I'd rather not open-source it since it's a tad bit worse.
